# TBI_Computation_App

This is the application for the computation of the Tunnel Brittleness Index (TBI) by Milan et al. (2024)

The Tunnel Brittleness Index (TBI) was created by Lorenzo Milan (Politecnico di Torino, email=lorenzo.milan@polito.it) as a part of his PhD research at Politecnico di Torino, with the help of his supervisors (professors Monica Barbero and Mauro Borri-Brunetto).

TBI is a preliminary design tool to forecast the occurrence of brittle or ductile rock failure around deep tunnels.

The app contained in this repository performs the computation of TBI based on its 9 input parameters. 

To use the app:

    The first time:
        1) run the MyAppInstaller_web. exe file
        2) run the TBI_Computation.exe file
        3) Wait a few seconds for a dialog box to appear
    From the second time:
        1) run the TBI_Computation.exe file
        2) Wait a few seconds for a dialog box to appea
